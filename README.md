# linalg-fl
A (minimal) linear algebra library for fl

## Background
fl is a framework that packages a strongly typed functional language, an efficient implementation of Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams (OBDDs), a SAT solver, symbolic simulation and the necessary visuzalization.
More information on fl can be found in this (private) github repo https://github.com/cjhseger/VossII

## Main intent of this project
To enable work realated to my research, this project aims to develop a linear numerical computation library. The library's scope is a little fluid at the moment.
